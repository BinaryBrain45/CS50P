# Speed Typing Test

Welcome to the Speed Typing Test repository! This Python project is designed to help you improve your typing speed and accuracy. With random sentence generation, speed measurement, and accuracy evaluation, it provides an engaging way to enhance your typing skills.

## Features

- **Random Sentences**: The program generates random sentences of varying difficulty levels for you to type. Each sentence presents a unique challenge and helps you practice typing in different contexts.

- **Speed Measurement**: The program calculates your typing speed in words per minute (WPM). By timing how quickly you can accurately type the given sentence, it provides valuable insights into your typing speed progress.

- **Accuracy Evaluation**: The program measures your typing accuracy by comparing the typed words with the original sentence. It gives you feedback on your precision and helps you identify areas for improvement.

- **Performance Metrics**: The program keeps track of your average typing speed and accuracy across multiple sentences. You can monitor your progress over time and strive for better results with each session.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/speed-typing-test.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd speed-typing-test
   ```

3. Run the program by executing the Python script:

   ```
   python project.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to select the difficulty level and start the typing test. You will be presented with random sentences to type, and the program will calculate your typing speed and accuracy for each sentence.
